# Introduction to Computer Vision
## Introduction
Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!

# Readings
## The structure of Fashion MNIST data
Here you saw how the data can be loaded into Python data structures that make it easy to train a neural network. You saw how the image is represented as a 28x28 array of greyscales, and how its label is a number. Using a number is a first step in avoiding bias -- instead of labelling it with words in a specific language and excluding people who don’t speak that language! You can learn more about bias and techniques to avoid it [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/fairness-overview/).

## Get hands-on with computer vision
Now that you’ve seen the workbook, it’s time to try it for yourself.  You can find it [here](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%201%20-%20Part%204%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook.ipynb). We’ve also provided a number of exercises you can try at the bottom of the workbook. These will help you poke around and experiment with the code, and will help you with the code you’ll need to write at the end of the week, so it’s really worth spending some time on them! I'd recommend you spend at least 1 hour playing with this workbook. It will be really worth your time!

When you’re done with that, the next thing to do is to explore callbacks, so you can see how to train a neural network until it reaches a threshold you want, and then stop training. You’ll see that in the next video.
