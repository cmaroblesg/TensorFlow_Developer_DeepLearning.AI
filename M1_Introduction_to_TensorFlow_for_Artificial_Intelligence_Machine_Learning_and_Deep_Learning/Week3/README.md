# Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
## Introduction
Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week we’ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here.

# Readings
## Coding convolutions and pooling layers
The concepts introduced in this video are available as [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D) layers and [MaxPooling2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) layers in TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to implement them in code in the next video…

## Learn more about convolutions
You’ve seen how to add a convolutional 2d layer to the top of your neural network in the previous video. If you want to see more detail on how they worked, check out the playlist at [https://bit.ly/2UGa7uH](https://bit.ly/2UGa7uH).
Now let’s take a look at adding the pooling, and finishing off the convolutions so you can try them out…

## Getting hands-on, your first ConvNet
You’ve now seen how to turn your Deep Neural Network into a Convolutional Neural Network by adding convolutional layers on top, and having the network train against the results of the convolutions instead of the raw pixels. In the next video, you’ll step through a workbook to see how this works…
