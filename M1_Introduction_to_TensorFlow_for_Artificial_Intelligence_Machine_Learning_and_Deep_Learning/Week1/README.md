# A New Programming Paradigm
## Introduction
Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In week 1 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along. You'll be working with code that works well across both TensorFlow 1.x and the TensorFlow 2.0 alpha. To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study...

## Resources
That brings you to the end of what you need to look at for Week 1. If youâ€™re eager to learn more, before we go to Week 2, there are some great resources you can check out:
* AI For Everyone is a non-technical course that will help you understand many of the AI technologies we will discuss later in this course, and help you spot opportunities in applying this technology to solve your problems. [https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-for-everyone/](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-for-everyone/)
+TensorFlow is available at [TensorFlow.org](TensorFlow.org), and video updates from the TensorFlow team are at youtube.com/tensorflow

Play with a neural network right in the browser at [http://playground.tensorflow.org](http://playground.tensorflow.org). See if you can figure out the parameters to get the neural network to pattern match to the desired groups. The spiral is particularly challenging!

The 'Hello World' notebook that we used in this course is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%201%20-%20Part%202%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook.ipynb).
